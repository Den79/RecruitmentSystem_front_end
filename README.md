- Automated processes:
- When a new job is created, assign the highest rated labourers available for up to

basis. Every Friday at 12:00am a schedule is generated for the week starting
Monday 10 days from then (full schedule is always available 10-17 days into the
future). Highest rated labourers go to the highest rated clients, in the case of a
tie the client with the larger job budget (overall labour request).
- Send schedule notifications via email to labourers and jobs
- Send notifications to admin any time an incident report is submit
